Project: Small-Medium Business Network Design and Implementation

Problem Statement: Created, constructed, and tested a scalable network architecture to support three different departments with differing requirements and account for potential future growth and spikes in service demand for a developing SME.
Process to Solution: Using layer 2 and layer 3 devices, a hierarchical network topology was created. Subnets were then put in place for sub-departments, a VPN was set up for remote sales, hot-swap load balancing was used to ensure resilience, and extensive monitoring of link status and utilisation was included.
Learning Outcomes: Developed proficiency in monitoring solutions for vital network infrastructure, improved problem-solving abilities in network scalability and resilience, and gained expertise in network design and configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer.
